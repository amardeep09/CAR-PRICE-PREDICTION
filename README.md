# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION
Determining whether the listed price of a used car is a challenging task, due to the many factors that drive a used vehicleâ€™s price on the market. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases. I have implemented and evaluated various learning methods on a dataset consisting of the sale prices of different makes and models from car dekho website. The results show that ExtraTreesRegressor and RandomizedSearchCV with Random search of parameters, using 3 fold cross validation yield the best results and this model is implemented as a web app using flask.
